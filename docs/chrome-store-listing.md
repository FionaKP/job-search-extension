## Privacy Practices Tab

### Single Purpose Description
JobFlow helps users save, organize, and track job applications from any job posting website using a visual Kanban board dashboard.

### Permission Justifications

#### activeTab
"activeTab is required to read job posting content from the current tab when the user clicks the extension icon. This allows JobFlow to extract job details (title, company, location, description) from the page the user is viewing. The permission is only activated when the user explicitly clicks the extension icon."

#### Host Permissions (<all_urls>)
"Host permission for all URLs is required because job postings appear on thousands of different websites (company career pages, job boards, applicant tracking systems). JobFlow needs to run its content script on any page to detect and extract job posting information when the user wants to save a job. No data is collected or transmitted - all extraction happens locally."

#### Storage
"Storage permission is used to save the user's job applications, connections, and preferences locally in Chrome's storage. All data remains on the user's device and is never transmitted to external servers. Users can export their data at any time."

#### Remote Code
"This extension does NOT use remote code. All JavaScript is bundled within the extension package. Select 'No' for remote code usage if this is a dropdown, or clarify: No remote code is loaded or executed."

### Data Usage Certification
- This extension does NOT collect any user data
- This extension does NOT transmit any data to external servers
- All data is stored locally in the user's browser using Chrome's storage API
- Users can export all their data as JSON at any time
- No analytics, tracking, or third-party services are used
