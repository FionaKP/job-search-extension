# Things to still do to make the UI better

- also maybe make in-progress a tag/mark on the saved but not a whole separate column (because they aren't very different)

* Compare action words from the description with resume of user and note or highlight what to change and add to optimize for the role
* change the excitement to dissapear to not make it overwhelming visually
* the keyboard shortcuts need to work everywhere (connections page too)

* connection, need an initial contact field too I think (in the form to create/add them to the dashboard)
    - Get image from linkedin?
    - make a graph view, or card view where people can be moced around and connected to each other? 
* Get rid of the red highlight when on a detail of a posting

## Data and posting display fix
* Update the scraping/keyword function to get technical and action words [longer term]
* Compare with user updated resume (technical and action words)

## Kanban Fixes
* Add slight tab with right arrows to stay contunuous with side tabs
