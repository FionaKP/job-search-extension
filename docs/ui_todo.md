# Things to still do to make the UI better

* The collapsable kanban ones slide to the right (so they are out of the way, and maybe do that by default? and then it doesn't add extra stuff in the middle in the way)
    - or make the roadmap as arrow sorta across the top, or stops and those are highlighted or accordioned based on if there is a post inside of it or if it is opened/closed by the user
* Make it all prettier! (colors and navigation)
* The popup should be better too with continuous color scheme. Need to determine a dark color to serve as a confident background or banner color
* be able to edit name, company, salary and other details to the posting once already saved AND maybe make it pop up like the the extension (because I think you can update) 
    - this includes the description as a copy and paste so the keywords is reliable. 
* Compare action words from the description with resume of user and note or highlight what to change and add to optimize for the role
* change the excitement scale to have 1-5 or zero and dissapear to not make it overwhelming visually
* Make the size of the columns expandable, so then the postings aren't as tall and more are visible at one time
* fix the logo thing - it sucks now
* the keyboard shortcuts need to work everywhere (connections page too)
* fix the connections page layout - its over the edge in a weird way
* Fix the list look, alignment and whats actually shown
