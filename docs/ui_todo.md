# Things to still do to make the UI better

* ~~The collapsable kanban ones slide to the right (so they are out of the way, and maybe do that by default? and then it doesn't add extra stuff in the middle in the way)~~
    - ~~or make the roadmap as arrow sorta across the top, or stops and those are highlighted or accordioned based on if there is a post inside of it or if it is opened/closed by the user [1/2way done ish]~~
    - ~~Make the size of the columns expandable/drag to size, so then the postings aren't as tall and more are visible at one time~~
    - Now with the expandable columns, make the stuff realign so that it gets shorter, (move the location/company to the right, etc.) And the stars and tags move inline with the square icon thing [so its just 2 lines]
* Fix the roadmap (should line up with categories below) 
    - also maybe make in-progress a tag/mark on the saved but not a whole separate column (because they aren't very different)
    - fix colors for each category to match vibe
    - Make the tabs make a little more sense, have a smaller tab part and a bit of color on the side too
    - maybe bring the color back to the kanban columns header and put the tab on the side of it to make it consistent
    - add annimation

* ~~Make it all prettier! (colors and navigation)~~

* ~~The popup should be better too with continuous color scheme. Need to determine a dark color to serve as a confident background or banner color~~ 
* be able to edit name, company, salary and other details to the posting once already saved AND maybe make it pop up like the the extension (because I think you can update) 
    - this includes the description as a copy and paste so the keywords is reliable. 
    - move the edit thing to the actual side detail, not the little card
* Compare action words from the description with resume of user and note or highlight what to change and add to optimize for the role
* change the excitement scale to have 1-5 or zero and dissapear to not make it overwhelming visually
* fix the logo thing - it sucks now
* the keyboard shortcuts need to work everywhere (connections page too)
* ~~fix the connections page layout - its over the edge in a weird way~~
* ~~Fix the list look, alignment and whats actually shown~~
* connection, need an initial contact field too I think (in the form to create/add them to the dashboard)
    - Get image from linkedin?
    - make a graph view, or card view where people can be moced around and connected to each other? 
* Get rid of the red highlight when on a detail of a posting

## Data and posting display fix
* Priority (out of 3) -> Interest/Exciting (out of 5)
* Fix expandable formatting 
* Logo !! 
* Details view 
    - Edit button for bigger categories (remove from kanban view, only in detatils)
    - Regular gray shade, not red
* Update the scraping/keyword function to get technical and action words [longer term]
* Compare with user updated resume (technical and action words)

## Kanban Fixes
* ~~Remove edit button from this view~~
*~~ add color headers back to kanban columns~~
* Add slight tab with right arrows to stay contunuous with side tabs
* ~~Add a slight color bar for the top tab on the right (look like folder edge)~~
*~~ add sliding animation to tabs in and out of collapse ~~
* Fix colors to correspond better with the status (red - rejected, applied - green, blue - interview, etc. (in vintage color scheme))
