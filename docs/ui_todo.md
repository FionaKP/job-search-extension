# UI Ideas & Improvements

> **Note:** For comprehensive remaining items list, see [REMAINING_ITEMS.md](./REMAINING_ITEMS.md)

---

## High Priority

- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts need to work everywhere (connections page too)
- [ ] Get rid of the red highlight when on a detail of a posting (use gray shade styling)
- [x] ~~Change the excitement to disappear to not make it overwhelming visually~~

## Medium Priority - Data & Display

- [ ] Update scraping/keyword function to get technical and action words (see Phase 5)
- [ ] Compare action words from description with user's resume to highlight optimization opportunities
- [ ] Consider making "in-progress" a tag/mark on saved, not a whole separate column

## Connections Enhancements

- [ ] Add initial contact field to connection form
- [ ] Get profile image from LinkedIn for connections
- [ ] Graph view or card view where people can be moved around and connected to each other

## Kanban Improvements

- [ ] Add slight tab with right arrows to stay continuous with side tabs (collapsed columns)
